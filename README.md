# Gesture Snap
Gesture Snap is a unique and innovative Android mobile application that allows you to capture photos using hand gestures. The application utilizes AI to detect and recognize hand gestures, enabling you to capture and save photos from your device.
## Installation
- Gesture Snap is not currently available on the Google Play Store now, but I will push it there as soon as possible.
- However, you can download and try it out from [here](https://pages.github.com/).

## Features
- **Gesture-based Photo Capture:** Utilizes AI technology to detect hand gestures for photo capturing. If the detected gesture matches the selected option, it captures a photo.
- **Image Saving:** Save captured photos to your device's storage.
- **Shooting Modes:** Includes grid mode, flash mode, and timer mode for versatile photo capturing options.
- **Image Gallery:** View and manage all photos stored on your device.
- **Single Image Viewing:** Select and view individual photos in full-screen mode.
- **Image Deletion:** Delete unwanted photos directly from the app.
> Note: With Android 10 (API 29), you are currently unable to delete multiple photos at once. I apologize for the inconvenience and will fix this issue as soon as possible.
